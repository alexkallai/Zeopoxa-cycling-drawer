# Zeopoxa-cycling-drawer
This CLI tool extracts the coordinates from the backed up database (sqlite3) of the Zeopoxa cycling app, and draws them on a picture, or creates a video of it

The first version is half bash, half Python, but I'm planning to write it in Python fully.

USAGE: ./zeopoxa-db-drawer.sh [DB FILE]
